Hi There! <br>
This is the source code for the [Yehwan Song: 2-day Workshop - INTL International Co building the website] <br>
Using this code you can build the collective 2d webpage and 3d space using google spreadsheet as a code editor.
You can find the final output of workshop here:http://theverycommonland.site/<br>
<br>
three.html is to create 3d space.<br>
two.html is to create 2d website.<br>
<br>
Download the entire file,<br>
open three.html/two.html and replace [APIKEY] and [SPREADSHEET ID]<br>
Helpful links below<br>
How to use google sheet api : https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts<br>
Create and use api key : https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys<br>
3d library : https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry<br>
<br>
Then you can start changing the spreadsheet:the change will be directly applied on the website<br>
The properties that you can use for the spreadsheet are:<br>
for 3D page : {color : #000000;  shape : cube;  text : A} {color : #000000;  shape : cube;  text : A}	<br>								
for 2D page : {Hexcolorpicker :  #ffffff OR rgb(0,0,0)	OR imagelink; Shape : Sphere OR box ;Text : single alphabet}<br> 																								<br>
it might be easier to understand if you take a look at the examples here:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-wdOY76BsW3Xr9MakF6hcJ1eM2G34RNKFfzVf5c144/edit#gid=1925615307<br>

Thanks! Ciao!
